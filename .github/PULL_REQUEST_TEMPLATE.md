<!--

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tails Express!

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create an issue to first discuss any significant new features. This includes things like adding new features, optimizations, etc.

# Contributing

The following contributing guidelines are based on [Tailwind Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Tails Express! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/asertym/Tails-Express/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any significant new ideas. This includes things like adding new features, optimizations, etc.

## Coding standards

Our code formatting rules are defined in [.eslintrc](https://github.com/asertym/Tails-Express/blob/master/.eslintrc.json). You can check your code against these standards by running:

```sh
npm run style
```

To automatically fix any style violations in your code, you can run:

```sh
npm run style -- --fix
```
